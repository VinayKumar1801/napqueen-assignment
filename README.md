## Styling
The Dashboard application utilizes Material-UI and SASS for styling purposes. Below is a brief description of each styling framework:

1.  Material-UI
Material-UI is a popular React UI framework that provides pre-built components following the Material Design guidelines. It offers a wide range of components with consistent styles, helping developers create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces. The Dashboard application leverages Material-UI components such as Table, TableContainer, TableHead, TableBody, TableCell, TableRow, Paper, Switch, Checkbox, and more.

2.  SASS
SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of regular CSS. It provides features like variables, nesting, mixins, and functions, which make styling more efficient and maintainable. The Dashboard application utilizes SASS to write modular and reusable stylesheets. The table.scss file is an example of using SASS for styling the table component.

Feel free to explore the codebase of the Dashboard application to learn more about the specific implementation details and customization options available.

That concludes the documentation for the Dashboard application. With this information, you should have a good understanding of how to install, use, and customize the Dashboard. Happy dashboarding!
